A fully functional E-commerce website built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).

This project focuses on implementing advanced search filtering, pagination, and efficient product search functionalities to provide a user-friendly shopping experience.

Key Features
Advanced Search Filtering: Users can filter products by name, category, brand, and price range. They can also combine multiple filters simultaneously for precise product discovery.
Pagination: The backend utilizes efficient pagination to ensure fast product loading and easy navigation through large datasets.
Sorting: Products can be sorted by price (ascending/descending) or by the date added (newest first) for convenient browsing.
Authentication: Secure user login is facilitated through integrated Google Authentication and Email/Password Authentication using Firebase.
Responsive Design: The website adopts a mobile-first approach, guaranteeing a visually appealing experience across all devices.
This project provided a valuable opportunity to solidify my full-stack development skills and implement best practices in writing clean and well-commented code.
